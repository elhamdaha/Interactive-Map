# Interactive-Map
Here I extracted data from Census API and TARGET, joined geo data with API and then calculated the population density for US States. At the end I used Folium function to visualize population density as an interactive map. 
I didn't save any shp. or csv. I just worked in the Jupyter environment. You can add a function to save the database or shp in your workbook.
